# PPM Image Editor in Python
Written for a school project. We were given the requirements, and the 
freedom to implement it as chosen in Python.
This was the turning point for me in seeing how heavy and deliberate 
design up front saves times in the implementation.
This program takes a PPM image as a commandline argument, 
and applies your choice of filters to it.
Filters/manipulations availbie: Horizonal flip, vertical flip, 
inverting colors, and flattening red, blue, or green.
