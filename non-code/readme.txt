## The Real MASH: A FAQ
This is my semester-long project for Technical Writing.
It is a frequently asked questions document focused on comparing the 
television show M*A*S*H with what actual MASH camps were like in the 
Korean War.
It was also written for a M*A*S*H Facebook fan group, where I posted it 
also.
